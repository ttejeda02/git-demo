Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

Yes, I did, so I packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a lil' somethin' show ya how we live
E'rybody want it but it ain't that serious
Mm-hmm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this

Did you realize
That you were a champion in their eyes?

You 'on't see just how wild the crowd is?
You 'on't see just how fly my style is?
I 'on't see why I need a stylist
When I shop so much I can speak Italian
I don't know I just want it better for my kids
And I ain't sayin' we was from the projects
But every time I wanted, layaway or a deposit
My dad'd say "When you see clothes, close your eyelids"

We was sorta like Will Smith and his son
In the movie, I ain't talkin' 'bout the rich ones
'Cause every summer he'd get some
Brand new hare-brained scheme to get rich from
And I don't know what he did for dough
But he'd send me back to school wit' a new wardrobe and ayy

Did you realize (ayy, ayy)
That you were a champion in their eyes? (Ayy)

I think he did, when he packed it up and brought it back to the crib
Just a lil' somethin' show ya how we lived
E'rything I wanted man it seemed so serious
Mm-hmm, that's that shit
So if you gon' do it, do it just like this
